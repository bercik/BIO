<a name="prerequisites"></a>
<h2>1. Prerequisites</h2>
<p>BIO compiler and interpreter works with java 1.8. You can download it <a href="https://www.java.com/pl/download/">here</a>. </p>
<a name="installation"></a>
<h2>2. Installation</h2>
<p>Download installer from <a href="https://github.com/bercik/BIO/releases">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>Run installer as root: <code>sudo java -jar bio_installer.jar</code></p>
<p>It will carry you with the instalation process. After that you can happily use <code>bio</code> and <code>bioc</code> commands. If you selected vim_plugin during installation and you have got vim installed you can also write programs with nice syntax coloring. To turn it on open vim and type <code>:syntax on</code>. You can also download all my vim configuration from <a href="https://github.com/bercik/dotfiles">here</a> which contains some useful plugins like parenthesis matching or auto comments and .vimrc config file.</p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>Enter command line by typing cmd in search panel.</p>
<p>Run installer: <code>java -jar bio_installer.jar</code></p>
<p>It will carry you with the instalation process. After that go to the folder when you install BIO (still in command line) and enter bin folder.</p>
<p>To run compiler and interpreter you need to type <code>bioc.bat</code> and <code>bio.bat</code> inside bin directory. To change this behavior you can add bin directory to your PATH enviromental variable.</p>
<h3>Mac</h3>
<p>Not supported yet.</p>
<h3>Compiling from sources</h3>
<p>If you want you can compile bio and bioc on your own. To do that you will need jdk 1.8 and netbeans. Than download source code from github, open /impl/bio_shared, /impl/bio and /impl/bioc as projects in netbeans and compile them all. After that in /impl/bio/dist you will find bio.jar and in /impl/bioc/dist you will find bioc.jar. These are interpreter and compilator java programs. You can also use /impl/bio/bio and /impl/bioc/bioc scripts which helps running these programs. </p>
<a name="first_program"></a>
<h2>3. First Program</h2>
<p>Now you are ready to write your first program in BIO, aren't you? So let's start with simple hello world.</p>
<p>Create file hello_world.bio and open it in your favourite text editor. I recommend using vim with vim plugin to coloring syntax which i created.</p>
<p>Paste this into text editor and save file:</p>
<p><code> def onSTART() <br /> &nbsp;PRINTLN("Hello world!") <br /> end </code></p>
<p>Now type this command: <code>bioc hello_world.bio</code></p>
<p>It will compile given file to an intermediate form and save it as a.cbio.</p>
<p>Now we can run our compiled file. To do so type: <code>bio a.cbio</code> and you should see string hello world! printed in console.</p>

<a name="functions"></a>
<h2>4. Defining functions</h2>
<p>In previous chapter we write this code:</p>
<p><code> def onSTART() <br /> &nbsp;PRINTLN("Hello world!") <br /> end </code></p>
<p>Now I will explain it. In first line:</p>
<p><code> def onSTART()</code></p>
<p>We define function onSTART which takes no parameters. If function takes some parameters you write their names in brackets separated with commas like this:</p>
<p><code>def some_function(par1, par2)</code></p>
<p>Function onSTART is speciall function which is executed at the start of program. It can take zero or one parameter which are command line arguments:</p>
<p><code>def onSTART(args)</code></p>
<p>Function name must start with upper or lower case letter or underline and than you can use letter, underline and digits. You can use all UTF-8 characters in function name. It can be expressed as this regular expression: [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]* where a-z,A-Z represents <b>any</b> letter. Same rules applies to parameters and variables name.</p>
<p>If you want to return something from function you need to call RETURN function which takes one parameter, for example:</p>
<p><code>RETURN(10)</code></p>
<p>This will return int 10.</p>
<p>Important thing is that if you don't specify return value than function will return none by default.</p>

<br />
<p>In second line we have:</p>
<p><code>PRINTLN("Hello world!")</code></p>
<p>This is function body, that is code that are executed when function is called</p>
<p>Every function needs to have got at least one function call inside their body. But there can be more, and there needs to be separated by whiteline character (typically newline, but can be space or tabulator). So you can do something like this:</p>
<p><code>def onSTART()<br/>&nbsp;PRINTLN("Hello")<br/>&nbsp;PRINTLN("world!")<br/>end</code></p>
<p>Or this:</p>
<p><code>def onSTART() PRINTLN("Hello") PRINTLN("world!") end</code></p>
<p>Which are equivalent.</p>
<p>Back to our code:</p>
<p><code>PRINTLN("Hello world!")</code></p>
<p>Here we are calling built in function <code>PRINTLN</code> with one parameter which are string <code>"Hello world!"</code>. You can find information about this and other built in functions in <a href="http://rcebula.ovh/static/bio/doc">BIO doc</a>.</p>
<p>One important thing about every function is that it must return some value. In this case we can read in documentation that <code>PRINTLN</code> function returns: "printed string".</p>
<p>Also in documentation if you look at <code>PRINTLN</code> function accepted parameters you will see: <code>"(&lt;val&gt;*)"</code>. This means, that this function can take cycling parameters, meaning zero or more <code>val</code>. So for example you can call it like this:</p>
<p><code>PRINTLN()</code></p>
<p>And it will just print new line on screen, or:</p>
<p><code>PRINTLN("a", "b", "c")</code></p>
<p>And it will print:</p>
<p><code>a<br/>b<br/>c<br/></code></p>

<br/>
<p>Our last line:</p>
<p><code>end</code></p>
<p>This is just the end of our function. Every function needs to have this word on the end.</p>

<a name="variables"></a>
<h2>5. Defining variables</h2>
<p>In BIO are two types of variables: local and global. Global variables as name suggest are accessible from whole program. You can assign one using <code>ASSIGN_GLOBAL</code> function, and get one using <code>GET_GLOBAL</code> function. Variable name, same as function name, must start with upper or lower case letter or underline and than you can use letter, underline and digits. You can use all UTF-8 characters in variable name. It can be expressed as this regular expression: [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]* where a-z,A-Z represents <b>any</b> letter. You can use same name for function and variable, these would be two diffrent things. So as example for assigning global variable:</p>
<p><code>def foo()<br/>&nbsp;ASSIGN_GLOBAL(x, 10)<br/>end<br/>def onSTART()<br/>&nbsp;foo()<br/>&nbsp;PRINTLN(GET_GLOBAL(x))<br/>end<br/></code></p>
<p>Code above would print 10.</p>
<br/>
<p>Local variables are accessible only from current function scope. But if you assign local variable it would be accessible for the rest of current function scope. There is no additional scopes inside function, like for example in IF or FOR function. So for example if you do:</p>
<p><code>def onSTART()<br/>&nbsp;IF(true, ASSIGN_LOCAL(flag, true), ASSIGN_LOCAL(flag, false))<br/>&nbsp;PRINTLN(flag)<br/>end<br/></code></p>
<p>This would print true, even if flag variable is assigned inside IF function. We will learn about IF function in next chapter.</p>
<p>You can get local variable just by typing their name or using <code>GET_LOCAL</code> function.</p>
<p>Read more about <a href="http://rcebula.ovh/static/bio/doc/#ASSIGN_LOCAL_fun">ASSIGN_LOCAL</a>, <a href="http://rcebula.ovh/static/bio/doc/#GET_LOCAL_fun">GET_LOCAL</a>,

<a name="control_statements"></a>
<h2>6. Control statements</h2>
<p>In BIO are two control statements: IF and FOR. IF is function that takes 2 or 3 arguments (third argument is optional, you don't need to specify it) and returns none (because every function in BIO must return some value). First parameter is condition, second is call that is called if condition is true, and third is call that is called if condition is false. So for example:</p>
<p><code>def onSTART()<br/>&nbsp;ASSIGN_LOCAL(number, TO_INT(INPUT("Type number: ")))<br/>&nbsp;IF(EQ(MOD(number, 2), 0), PRINTLN("even"), PRINTLN("odd"))<br/>end<br/></code></p>
<p>This code would get number from user and print if its odd or even.</p>
<p>Notice what happens if you pass something that is not a number, for example: "a". You would get:</p>
<p><code>
   Type number: a<br/>
   [In file 6.1.bio, line: 3, character: 2]: In function JMP_IF_FALSE expected 0 parameter to be bool got error<br/>
   caused by [In file 6.1.bio, line: 3, character: 8]: In function EQ expected 0 parameter to be array, bool, dict, float, int, none, string, tuple got error<br/>
   caused by [In file 6.1.bio, line: 3, character: 12]: In function MOD expected 0 parameter to be array, float, int, tuple got error<br/>
   caused by [In file 6.1.bio, line: 2, character: 30]: In function TO_INT can't convert string "a" to int<br/>
   <br/>
   Stack trace:<br/>
   [In file generated by compiler, line: -1, character: -1]: onSTART<br/>
</code></p>
<p>What we can read is that: "In function TO_INT can't convert string "a" to int". That is clear as you can't convert "a" to int. Function TO_INT at this moment returns error which we are assigned to variable number. What happens next is that we try to call function MOD on variable number which is error and number 2. This gaves as another error: "In function MOD expected 0 parameter to be array, float, int, tuple got error". That is clear because MOD function can't take errors, only numbers. We pass this error value to EQ function which also can't take error as parameter: "In function EQ expected 0 parameter to be array, bool, dict, float, int, none, string, tuple got error" so it returns another error, and finally we pass this value as condition to IF function. Now what happens is that IF function create error ("In function JMP_IF_FALSE expected 0 parameter to be bool got error"). You see here not IF but JMP_IF_FALSE function name, this is caused by the fact, that IF function in reallity is not function but it is evaluated to intermediate code during compilation process and it's generated JMP_IF_FALSE instruction. It returns this error from current function which is onSTART. If that happens onUNHANDLED_ERROR event is called but there are no observers attached to it, so error is printed on screen and program is exited. We will learn more about observer pattern and error handling in next chapters.</p>
<p>What we can do to enhance this code is to check if user pass number like this:</p>
<p><code>def onSTART()<br/>&nbsp;ASSIGN_LOCAL(number, TO_INT(INPUT("Type number: ")))<br/>&nbsp;IF<br/>&nbsp;(<br/>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;IS_ERROR(number),<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINTLN("That's not a number!"),<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;IF(EQ(MOD(number, 2), 0), PRINTLN("even"), PRINTLN("odd"))<br/>&nbsp;)<br/>end<br/></code></p>
<p>Here we are checking if number is error and if it is we print information about this. Else we do what we did in previous script.</p>
<p>So if you pass "a" it will print:</p>
<p><code>Type number: a<br/>
   That's not a number!<br/></code></p>
<br/>
<p>FOR is function that takes 4 parameters, first is call that is executed at the beginning, second is condition that breaks loop if it's false, third is call that is executed on every loop iteration but can be skipped with CONTINUE function, and fourth parameter is call that is executed on every loop iteration but can't be skipped with CONTINUE function (it's guarantee that it will be called after every loop iteration). In case you don't pass bool as condition the same behavior as in IF function would happen. You can use BREAK() function inside FOR to break execution of loop or CONTINUE() function to skip current iteration. As example of FOR loop we will write program that do fizz buzz:</p>
<p><code>def onSTART()<br/>&nbsp;FOR<br/>&nbsp;(<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;ASSIGN_LOCAL(i, 1),<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;LS(i, 100),<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;CALL<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;(<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IF(EQ(MOD(i, 15), 0), CALL(PRINT("Fizz Buzz,"), CONTINUE()), DN()),<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IF(EQ(MOD(i, 3), 0), CALL(PRINT("Fizz,"), CONTINUE()), DN()),<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IF(EQ(MOD(i, 5), 0), CALL(PRINT("Buzz,"), CONTINUE()), DN()),<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINT(ADD(TO_STRING(i), ","))<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;),<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;INC(i)<br/>&nbsp;)<br/>end<br/></code></p>
<p>Here we are using CALL and DN functions. CALL function is function that executes every function passed to it and returns what last passed function returns. DN function is function that just do nothing. You can use it to emulate WHILE loop known from other programming languages:</p>
<p><code>def onSTART()<br/>&nbsp;ASSIGN_LOCAL(i, 0)<br/>&nbsp;FOR(DN(), LS(i, 10), CALL(PRINTLN(i), INC(i)), DN())<br/>end<br/></code></p>
