!desc If the <i>prompt</i> argument is present, it is written to standard output (typically screen) without a trailing newline. The function then reads a line from standard input (typically console), converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that. If there are repeated <i>prompt</i> arguments than there will be showed one after each other and for each one string from input would be read. The whole would be returned as array.
!repeat prompt (string) string to be showed to user
!return (string, array) If you pass zero or one prompt argument returns string, otherwise array of strings
!error (BAD_PARAMETER_TYPE) If any <i>prompt</i> argument is not string
