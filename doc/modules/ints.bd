!name RSHIFT
!desc Right shifts <i>num</i> by <i>shift</i> bits. If you pass collections than element at every index in first collection would be right shifted by element at same index in second collection bits
!param num (int, array, tuple) 
!param shift (int, array, tuple) 
!return (int, array) if you pass ints right shifted int. If you pass collections array of right shifted ints
!error (BAD_PARAMETER_TYPE) If <i>num</i> or <i>shift</i> is not int, array or tuple or if you mixed ints and collections or if collections contains not only ints

!name LSHIFT
!desc Left shifts <i>num</i> by <i>shift</i> bits. If you pass collections than element at every index in first collection would be left shifted by element at same index in second collection bits
!param num (int, array, tuple) 
!param shift (int, array, tuple) 
!return (int, array) if you pass ints left shifted int. If you pass collections array of left shifted ints
!error (BAD_PARAMETER_TYPE) If <i>num</i> or <i>shift</i> is not int, array or tuple or if you mixed ints and collections or if collections contains not only ints

!name XOR
!desc Perform xor (exclusive or) operation on two given ints. If you pass collections then it will xor every element from both collections at given index
!param a (int, array, tuple) 
!param b (int, array, tuple) 
!return (int, array) if you pass ints xored int. If you pass collections array of xored ints
!error (BAD_PARAMETER_TYPE) If <i>a</i> or <i>b</i> is not int, array or tuple or if you mixed ints and collections or if collections contains not only ints
